/*
According to "Poverty of Housing in Rural India", M. Mahadeva:
The total housing stock of the country has been classified under three categories, pucca, semi-pucca and kutcha, on the basis of the materials used to construct the walls and roof.
Kutcha housing is further classified into serviceable (having solid mud walls but a thatched root) and non-serviceable housing (with walls and roof, both made of flimsy materials) which need to be rebuilt at short intervals as they may not last long.
